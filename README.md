<h2>Parking Ticket App</h2>

This is a Python project which aims to build a terminal application that  provides a user friendly experience. It aims to provide users with an application that's efficient, well designed and reliable to use, but also a time-saving solution for people who need to buy parking tickets in different zones around Brisbane, where access to machines isn't available. Ideally, it could be used on any mobile device, working with City Councils and private businesses who need a management system to take the heavy work out of creating and maintaining their own ticketing system.


<h2> R5 Styleguide</h2>

<p>This project adheres to PEP 8 styling conventions. This is the styling convention I've been using since first learning to code in Python so I'll continue to use it.</p>
